This method combines on-chain decision-making with essential off-chain governance, typically conducted via platforms like Discord or Discourse.</p><p>This model has gained popularity due to its effectiveness in grant allocation. However, in the context of Grant Ships, where direct funding is managed through a separate interface, DAOhaus&#39;s role pivots to facilitating other governance aspects.</p><h2 id="application-in-grant-ships" tabindex="-1">Application in Grant Ships <a class="header-anchor" href="#application-in-grant-ships" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Application in Grant Ships&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The use of DAOhaus in Grant Ships could unfold as follows:</p><ol><li>A grantee submits a detailed proposal on the ship&#39;s forum.</li><li>DAO members review the proposal and discuss it off-chain.</li><li>A decision is made on whether to move the proposal on-chain.</li><li>If approved, a Grant Ship member sponsors the proposal.</li><li>The proposal goes to a vote.</li><li>If successful, a funding request is presented against the allocation pool.</li><li>Upon approval, funds are distributed accordingly.</li></ol><h2 id="pros-of-using-daohaus-for-ship-design" tabindex="-1">Pros of Using DAOhaus for Ship Design <a class="header-anchor" href="#pros-of-using-daohaus-for-ship-design" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pros of Using DAOhaus for Ship Design&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Enhanced Governance</strong>: DAOhaus facilitates a structured, democratic decision-making process.</li><li><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: Encourages active participation and discussion among ship members.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong>: On-chain voting ensures a transparent and accountable governance mechanism.</li><li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Integrates both on-chain and off-chain elements, allowing for a hybrid governance model.</li></ul><h2 id="cons-of-using-daohaus-for-ship-designs" tabindex="-1">Cons of Using DAOhaus for Ship Designs <a class="header-anchor" href="#cons-of-using-daohaus-for-ship-designs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Cons of Using DAOhaus for Ship Designs&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Complexity</strong>: May present a learning curve for members unfamiliar with DAO or blockchain governance.</li><li><strong>Limited Direct Funding Control</strong>: As funding is handled externally, DAOhaus&#39;s role in financial decisions is restricted.</li><li><strong>Dependence on Off-Chain Platforms</strong>: Relies on external communication tools for off-chain governance, which could fragment the decision-making process.</li><li><strong>Sponsorship Dependency</strong>: Proposals require sponsorship from a ship member, which could create bottlenecks.</li></ul><p>DAOhaus presents a unique and powerful tool for Grant Ship governance, blending traditional and innovative governance models.
