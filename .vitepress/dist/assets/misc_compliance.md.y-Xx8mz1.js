This process is essential for verifying identities and preventing fraud, ensuring that funds are awarded to legitimate and credible entities.</li><li><strong>Purposeful Use of Funds</strong>: Recipients must use the awarded funds strictly for the intended and explicitly stated purposes as outlined in their grant applications.
