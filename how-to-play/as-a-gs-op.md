# How To Play As A Grant Ship Operator

If you or your team have been selected to operate a Grant Ship, congratulations!

### Grant Ship Operators:

- Are responsible for signaling their Allocation Intents (disclosures)
- Capture Grant recipient details and include them in the disclosure
- Ensure Grant Recipients disclose progress on work completed

### How it Works

Your primary responsibility is to be a good steward of the funds you are entrusted with.

You will need to determine your unique approach to grant giving and distribute the funds through the Grant Ships dashboard.

At the end of the season, you'll have an opportunity to report on your progress and the community will vote to determine if you will receive additional funding in the following season, or be slashed relative to other Grant Ships.

If your performance is too poor, you may be jettisoned and another crew will take over your position!
