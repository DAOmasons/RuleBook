You will need to determine your unique approach to grant giving and distribute the funds through the Grant Ships dashboard.

At the end of the season, you'll have an opportunity to report on your progress and the community will vote to determine if you will receive additional funding in the following season, or be slashed relative to other Grant Ships.
