# How To Play As A Grant Ship Operator

If you or your team have been selected to operate a Grant Ship, congratulations!

<h3><img src="/grantship_icon.svg" style="display: inline; vertical-align: middle;" alt="Grant Ship Icon" /> Grant Ship Operators:</h3>

- Apply to be a Ship Operator by describing their approach and qualifications.
- Steward the funds entrusted to them by the community, if selected.
- Participate in the end-of-round review process.

### How it Works

The primary responsibility of a Grant Ship Operator is to be a good steward of the funds they are entrusted with.

Each Ship Operator determines their unique approach to grant giving and distribute the funds through the provided interface.

At the end of the funding round, Ship performance will be assessed by a community and/or judge vote. This vote will impact their the following round, rewarding high-performing Ships and potentially slashing underperforming Ships.

### Examples:

- In the Gitcoin Grants funding rounds, each Ship is a targeted matching funds round responsible for soliciting projects and donations.
- During the Arbitrum pilot round, three Ship operators competed to give the best direct, milestone-based grants. The vote led to one ship's "crash and burn" and the other two ships receiving additional funds for the next round.
