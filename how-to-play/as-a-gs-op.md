# How To Play As A Grant Ship Operator

If you or your team have been selected to operate a Grant Ship, congratulations!

### Grant Ship Operators:

- Are responsible for signaling their Allocation Intents (distributions)
- Create onchain attestations for important updates or announcments (disclosures)
- Encourage Grant Recipients to disclose progress on work completed

### How it Works

Your primary responsibility as a Grant Ship Operator is to be a good steward of the funds you are entrusted with.

You will need to determine your unique approach to grant giving and distribute the funds through the Grant Ships dashboard.

At the end of the funding round, you'll have an opportunity to report on your progress and the community will vote to determine if you will receive additional funding in the following funding round, or be slashed relative to other Grant Ships.

If your performance is too poor, you may be jettisoned and another crew will take over your position!
