We are currently accepting applications to fill positions in our beta season of Grant Ships. The main roles we need are Grant Ships operators. You must be able to co-ordinate with other people in a decentralized manner. You and your team will design your own micro grants program and have the opportunity to distribute almost 30K $Arb tokens during the beta round, to projects that provide impact on Arbitrum.

If you are interested in taking part, please fill out the form:
