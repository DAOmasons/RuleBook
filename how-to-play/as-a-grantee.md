# How To Play As A Grantee

Because Grant Ships uses a pluralistic approach to grant giving, each Grant Ship will have its own method of selecting Grant Recipients.

The Grant Ships dashboard will supply you with the information you need to contact them and begin the process.

If a Grant Ship decides to fund your project, you can expect to receive your funds after Game Facilitators have reviewed and approved the request.

From then on, your relationship is with the Grant Ship crew and the Arbitrum DAO community. If you do well, it reflects well on your sponsoring Grant Ship, so you can expect them to be invested in your success.
