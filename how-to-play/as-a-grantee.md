# How To Play As A Grant Recipient

Grant Recipients bring projects that are selected and funded by Grant Ships.

- Responsible for describing their goals in a project application
- Responsible for delivering on promises made in the application
- Responsible for sharing progress in a way that Grant Ships and DAO Members can understand

### How it Works

The Grant Ships dashboard will supply you with the information you need to contact the funding Grant Ship and begin the application process.

If a Grant Ship decides to fund your project, you can expect to receive your funds after Game Facilitators have reviewed and approved the request and you've completed and submitted a milestone.

From then on, your relationship is with the Grant Ship crew and the Arbitrum DAO community. If you do well, it reflects well on your sponsoring Grant Ship. Expect your Grant Ship to be invested in your success.
