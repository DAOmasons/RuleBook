# How To Play As A Project Owner

Project Owners bring Projects that are (hopefully) selected and funded by Grant Ships.

- Responsible for describing their goals in a project application
- Responsible for delivering on promises made in the application
- Responsible for sharing progress in a way that Grant Ships and DAO Members can understand

### How it Works

> In the Grant Ships app, the <img src="/public/project_icon.svg" style="display: inline; vertical-align: middle;" alt="Grant Ship Icon" /> icon represents Project activity.

Once Ships are selected, they will be looking for Projects to fund.

Each Grants program is different, but Project Owners will have a way to apply to each Ship for funding.

When a Ship approves a project, that project is ready to participate in that Ship's funding round.

By following the Ship's rules and delivering on the project, the Project Owner can earn funding from that Ship.

Projects are free to apply to multiple Ships.

### Examples:

- The Gitcoin Grants round has each Ship taking project applications to receive matching funds.
- During the pilot round, Arbitrum Gaming projects applied for grants directly from Ship Operators.
