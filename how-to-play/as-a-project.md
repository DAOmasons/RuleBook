# How To Play As A Project Owner

Project Owners bring Projects that are (hopefully) selected and funded by Grant Ships.

- Describe their project to Ships in an application
- Deliver on promises made in the application

### How it Works

Once Ships are selected, they will be looking for Projects to fund.

Each community is different, but Project Owners will have a way to apply to the Ships for funding.

When a Ship approves a project, that project is ready to participate in that Ship's funding round.

By following the Ship's rules and delivering on their project promises, the Project Owner can earn funding from that Ship.

Projects are free to apply to multiple Ships.

### Examples:

- In the Gitcoin Grants round, each Ship takes project applications. Selected projects are rewarded with matching funds when they receive community donations.
- During the Arbitrum pilot round, gaming projects applied for grants directly from the Ships and were rewarded with milestone-based funding.
