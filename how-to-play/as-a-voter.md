# How To Play as a Voter

As a community member you get to vote on the performance of the Ship Operators. Your vote impacts how much funding each Ship will receive in the upcoming round.

### Voters:

- Vote to elect Grant Ships in the setup phase
- Vote after each Grant Ship allocation round

> Some DAOs may choose to assign or elect judges to vote on Ship performance, or use a combination of community and judges.

### How Voting works

After each funding round, Voters have an opportunity to vote for the Ship Operators that they believe are performing the best.

Each community decides how the voting process works, and how that translates to Ship rewards. Voting can be a token-curated registry (TCR) vote, elected judge votes, or purely based on objective metrics chosen by the community (potentially chosen through a TCR vote) or a combination of these.

#### The basic reward cycle is:

Ships that receive **more votes** are rewarded in future rounds. This could mean automatic inclusion in future rounds, or being granted additional funds to distribute.

Ships that receive **fewer votes** may be slashed in future rounds. This could mean reduced funding relative to peers, or losing their position to open the way for new Ship Operators.

In this way Voters shape the grants program over time.

> Each DAO can configure Grant Ships differently but the basic principle is the same: **Voters decide which Grant Ships are performing the best and performance is rewarded in future rounds**
