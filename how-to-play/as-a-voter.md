# How To Play as a Voter

As a community member you get to vote on the performance of the Ship Operators. Your vote impacts how much funding each Ship will receive in the upcoming round.

### Voters:

- Vote to elect Grant Ships in the setup phase
- Vote after each Grant Ship allocation round

> Some DAOs may choose to assign or elect judges to vote on Ship performance, or use a combination of community and judges.

### How Voting works

![](/public/pie_chart.jpg)

After each funding round, Voters have an opportunity to vote on their favorite Grant Ships.

Ships that receive **more votes** are trusted with **more funds** in future rounds.

Each DAO decides how the voting process works, and how that translates to Ship rewards.

In this way Voters shape the grants program over time.

> Each DAO can configure Grant Ships differently but the basic principle is the same: **Voters decide which Grant Ships are performing the best.**
