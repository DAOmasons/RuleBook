# How To Play as a Voter

As community member you get to vote on the performance of the Ship Operators. Your vote impacts how much funding each Ship will receive in the upcoming round.

### Voters:

- Vote to elect Grant Ships in the setup phase
- Vote after each Grant Ship allocation round

> For the pilot round, Ship Operators were selected by Game Facilitators.

### How Voting works

![](/public/pie_chart.jpg)

After each funding round, Voters have an opportunity to vote on their favorite Grant Ships.

Ships that receive **more votes** are trusted with **more funds** in future rounds.

Ships that don't get enough votes (e.g. 10% of total) may be jettisoned from their ship and replaced by a new Ship Operator.

In this way Voters shapes the grants program, determining who is given more resources, and who should be slashed, and who should be replaced.

> Each DAO can configure Grant Ships differently, for instance when determine minimum voting thresholds for Ships to continue
