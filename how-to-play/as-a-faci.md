# How To Play As A Game Facilitator

Game Facilitators arbitrate the game rules and verify Grant Ship distributions.

### Game Facilitators:

- Review Allocation Disclosures from Grant Ships to ensure they are not malicious
- Approve fund allocations to projects as per request from Grant Ships
- Flag Grant Ships that are not operating by the rulebook
- Host live Minting Events where they approve Allocation Disclosures

### How it Works

When a Grant Ship is ready to distribute funds to a Grant Recipient, they create a request that is reviewed by Game Facilitators.

If the grant request meets the approval criteria, Game Facilitators execute the request and funds are distributed.

They are also responsible for administrative tasks related to setting up community votes, initiate new seasons and keeping the community apprised of progress in the Grant Ships game.
