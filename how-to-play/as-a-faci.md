- Perform administrative and oversight tasks as determined by the hosting community.

### How it Works

Game Facilitators have special permissions to affect the game flow within guidelines determined by the hosting community.

They are responsible for administrative tasks related to setting up the funding rounds, administering community votes, initiating new funding rounds and keeping the community apprised of progress and calls to action.

### For example:

- During the Gitcoin Grants rounds, Game Facilitators administered a judge election and specified community token vote parameters.
- During the Arbitrum pilot round, Game Facilitators reviewed and approved Ship applications, and unlocked funds for distribution by Ships to Projects.
