- Perform administrate and oversight tasks as determined by the hosting DAO

### How it Works

> In the Grant Ships app, the <img src="/public/gamefacilitator_icon.svg" style="display: inline; vertical-align: middle;" alt="Grant Ship Icon" /> icon represents Game Facilitator activity.

Game Facilitators have special permissions to affect the game flow.

These permissions (and constraints) are determined by the hosting DAO.

They are also responsible for administrative tasks related to setting up community votes, initiate new funding rounds and keeping the community apprised of progress in the Grant Ships game.

### For example:

- During the Arbitrum Gaming pilot round, Game Facilitators reviewed and approved Ship applications, and unlocked funds for distribution by Ships to Projects.
