# How To Play As A Game Facilitator

Game Facilitators play an important role in the operation of the Grant Ships Game.

When a Grant Ship is ready to distribute funds to a grant recipient, they create a request that is reviewed by Game Facilitators.

If the grant request meets the approval criteria, Game Facilitators execute the request and funds are distributed.

They are also responsible for administrative tasks related to setting up community votes, initiate new seasons and keeping the community apprised of progress in the Grant Ships game.
