Grant Ships is styled as a game that brings competition and accountability.

Each participant has a unique role in the game. How would you like to play?

### [Grant Ship Operators](/how-to-play/as-a-gs-op)

You are the steward of your own grants program. Receive funds and allocate them wisely.

### [Project Grantees](/how-to-play/as-a-project)

Your job is to apply for funding from Ship Operators, build your project and report on your progress.

### [Voters](/how-to-play/as-a-voter)

You decide which Ship Operators are performing the best. Top performers are rewarded in future rounds.

### [Game Facilitators](/how-to-play/as-a-faci)

Game Facilitators help manage the game, and ensure that all participants are following the rules.
