# How To Play As Delegated Arbitrum Voter

As an Arbitrum Delegated Voter, you have an important role to play within Grant Ships.

After each funding season, Voters have an opportunity to vote on their favorite Grant Ships.

Ships that receive more votes are trusted with more funds in future rounds.

Ships that don't meet a certain voting threshold may have their crew jettisoned! If that happens, new crews will be chosen (using ARB voting) to man the Grant Ship.

Voters also have the ability to revoke permissions from Grant Ships and Game Facilitators outright.

In this way the Arbitrum DAO community shapes the Grant Ships program, determining who is given more resources, and who should be replaced.

Delegated Arbitrum Voters

- Vote to elect Grant Ships in the setup phase
- Vote in Grant Ship allocation rounds to determine the efficacy of each ship
- Vote to revoke roles from teams that are not acting in the best interest of the DAO. For example, if Game Facilitators are abusing power or not acting by their mandate, the DAO can revoke their role and elect new Game Facilitators.
