# An Evolutionary Grants Framework

Grant Ships is an evolutionary grants framework designed to refine and advance best practices through a dynamic mix of competition, collaboration, and skill-sharing among grant programs.

Selected grant programs — known as "Ships" — innovate and engage in a public arena, where they are observed and evaluated by the community and/or designated judges.

These assessments set each Ship’s starting position for the next round, rewarding top performers and allowing new Ships to join. This iterative cycle drives continuous innovation, leading to ever-improving strategies and outcomes.

### Key Features:

- **Onchain** All data and user actions occur onchain.
- **Community Powered**: Your Community keeps control over funds even while giving permission to Ships to distribute funds.
- **Public Process**: From grant application to milestone delivery, every activity is onchain and displayed for public eyes. No more mystery back room deals. All outcomes are visible.
- **Checked & Balanced:** Multiple stakeholders are involved in every transaction, providing checks and balances before funds are distributed.
- **Protected Funds:** No direct access to funds by any one actor within the game. All distributions are made through smart contracts and recorded and published onchain in a transparent manner.
