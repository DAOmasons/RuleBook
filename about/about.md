# An Evolutionary Grants Framework

The Grant Ships platform allows multiple teams (aka Ship Operators) within one DAO to give grants side-by-side. The sponsor DAO puts grant funds into one fund, then it is split among the multiple teams.

The Grant Ships platform allows each Grant Ship operator to accept applications and make allocations to selected recipients. Every transaction is recorded onchain and displayed in the application's feed.

At the end of a funding round, a token-curated DAO vote is held. The vote results determine relative funding levels for each Ship are proportional to the amount of votes received.

### Key Features:

- **A Turn-key Grants Program for your DAO:** Just supply the funds and Grant Ships handles the rest.
- **Revokable Roles**: Your DAO keeps control over funds even while delegating authority to distribute funds to Ship Operators.
- **Multi-step Allocation Process:** Operators and Game Facilitators are involved in every transaction, providing checks and balances before funds are distributed.
- **Protected Funds:** No direct access to funds by any one actor within the game. All distributions are made through smart contracts and recorded and published onchain in a transparent manner.

## The Grant Ships Concept

Grant Ships is more than just a funding mechanism; it's a strategic game that brings life to pluralistic, decentralized governance. By gamifying the process of grant distribution, we seek to enhance participation, effectiveness, and inclusivity.

## Roles in Grant Ships

### Voters

Delegated voters play a pivotal role in shaping the Grant Ships program. They are responsible for electing Grant Ships, voting in allocation rounds, and ensuring the integrity of the ecosystem.

### Game Facilitators

These crucial players oversee the distribution of funds to grant recipients, ensuring compliance with the rulebook and maintaining the overall health of the game.

### Grantees

Participants who receive funding through Grant Ships. They are responsible for delivering on their proposals and keeping the community updated on their progress.

### Grant Ship Operators

Teams selected to operate a Grant Ship, responsible for stewarding funds, designing grant programs, and ensuring transparent and effective grant distribution.

## The Game Mechanics

From the setup phase to the allocation of funds, Grant Ships operates as an engaging game. Participants undergo a process of proposal submission, community voting, and transparent fund allocation, all driven by DAO-powered collective decision-making.

## Community and Decentralization

At the core of Grant Ships is the community. The decentralized nature of the game ensures that power and decision-making are distributed among its members, fostering a diverse and resilient ecosystem.

## Advantages of Grant Ships

Participation in Grant Ships offers numerous benefits, including a democratic involvement in governance, increased transparency and trust, and the fostering of innovation and impact for the web3 ecosystem.

## Conclusion

Grant Ships stands for a transparent, participatory and decentralized grant allocation.
