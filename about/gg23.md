## What is Grant Ships?

### Iterative Feedback

The heart of Grant Ships is its iterative feedback loop. Grant Ships provides an iterative cycle of Performance > Assessment > Reward for continuous improvement of community-driven metrics.

## How it Works for GG23

### Stage 1: Judge Elections

![](/stage1.png)

The Gitcoin Community Council will serve as the judges. These are professional Gitcoin delegates chosen by the community.

Their role is to review and select the Community Rounds (Ships) for the round based on a selection criteria rubric provided by Gitcoin and oversee the Grant Ships/GG23 process.

> See the [2025 Delegate Nominations](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2025-delegate-nominations/19903) on the Gitcoin forums for more information.

### Stage 2: Round Selection

Anybody may apply to be selected as a Ship Operator. This application process is very similar to past Gitcoin Grants rounds, but now the application process is through the Grant Ships app.

Grant Ships is to be visible and transparent, so all applications are public and can be reviewed by the community.

Check the Applications link to see all the applications for the current round.

### Stage 3: Community Rounds

This is the Gitcoin community round that we all know and love.

The original Gitcoin interface will still handle the rounds and all the donations, but the Grant Ships dashboards will have links to help you keep track of how the Ships are performing.

### Stage 4: Community Review

After the Ships have completed their rounds, the community will have an opportunity to review the performance of the Ships.

For GG23, this will be a GTC-based vote. Each token holder will be able to signal on which Ships they believe performed the best.

For GG23, the top performers will be rewarded with streamlined access to GG24. In future rounds the top performers may be rewarded with additional matching funds.

## Things to Know

### Grant Ships is Onchain and Transparent

Grant Ships is completely onchain, so all applications and votes are recorded on the blockchain. This means that all data is public and transparent.

### Future Plans

We're starting simple with GG23. Every community is different, and based on feedback and needs expressed we will be able to adjust the framework to better suit the needs of the Gitcoin community.

#### Future rounds may include:

- high performing teams automatically included in the next round
- high performing teams rewarded with additional matching funds in future rounds
- community round metrics tied directly to performance review (in addition to the community vote)
- badges and other reputation systems for high performing teams and involved voters
- additional GTC utility features
