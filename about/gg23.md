# Gitcoin Grants Community Round 23

Grant Ships is the meta-governance framework for the Gitcoin Grants funding rounds starting with [GG23](https://gg23.grantships.com).

### Iterative Feedback

The heart of Grant Ships is its iterative feedback loop. Grant Ships provides an iterative cycle of Performance > Assessment > Reward for continuous improvement.

### How it Works

Community rounds apply to be selected as normal, but now the application process is through the Grant Ships app.

A panel of elected judges review the application and use the Grant Ships onchain voting rubric mechanism to select the Ships for the round.

The Ships then perform normal Gitcoin Grants rounds. Next, the community will use the Grant Ships app to vote on the performance of the Ships using GTC.

For GG23, the top performers will be rewarded with streamlined access to GG24. In future rounds the top performers may be rewarded with additional matching funds.

### Onchain and Transparent

Grant Ships is completely onchain, so all applications and votes are recorded on the blockchain. This means that all data is public and transparent.

### Future Plans

We're starting simple with GG23. Every community is different, and based on feedback and needs expressed we will be able to adjust the framework to better suit the needs of the Gitcoin community.

#### Future rounds may include:

- high performing teams automatically included in the next round
- high performing teams rewarded with additional matching funds in future rounds
- community round metrics tied directly to performance review (in addition to the community vote)
- badges and other reputation systems for high performing teams and involved voters
- additional GTC utility features
