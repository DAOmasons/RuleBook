# The Voting Round

After round 1 of the Pilot, we held a dual-token vote to determine the winning Ship Operators.

The first token was ARB, allowing Arbitrum DAO to signal which Operators it felt best allocated funds.

The second token was Grant Ships Voting Token airdropped to participants and judges familiar with the program.

## Arbitrum Vote

The Arbitrum Vote was held first. A total of 5393040.91 ARB was used by delegated Arbitrum voters to signal on which Grant Ship Operator performed best.

Ship "The Jade Shadow" was eliminated in this round.

## Community Vote

The Community Vote followed the Arbitrum vote, and was between the 2 remaining Ships.

We airdropped Grant Ships Voting Tokens (GSVT) totaling 103,637 to grant recipients, ship operators and a selection of community judges.

### How we Apportioned GSVT

GSVT tokens were apportioned as follows:
| Voter | Count | % |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Ships|3|20%|
|Projects|8|40%|
|Judges|12|40%|

### Project Voting Power

For the 40% apportioned to projects, each project was given a base amount of GSVT for having received a grant, plus an amount based on the funding they received across all ships and portion of milestones they completed.

### Ships and Judges

Ships and Judges were given a set amount, split evenly across each.

Judges were selected from the community from individuals who are familiar with the Grant Ships project and enthusiastic about participating.

### Voting turnout

Of these 103,637 airdropped voting tokens, 64456 (62%) were used to vote.

Of active voters, projects represented 51% of voting power, Ships 21% and Judges 28%.

The active voters were:
| Voter | GSVT | Type |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Monkey Empire|5506|Project|

### Voting Bonus

To encourage voting activity, we will be airdropping additional voting power to those who participated in the previous round according to the following rubrik.

We've created 5 levels of bonus for various in-game activities.

| Level | Bonus | Activities                                                                         |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

- At the end of Round 2, these GSVT will be added to voter totals.
- All bonuses are subject to Facilitator view for quality and to prevent sybil, spoofing, etc.
- Individual voting totals are relative and may be prorated to keep total GSVT airdrop at 100,000 GSVT or similar.

### Editorial Guideline

To encourage the community to create thoughtful analysis and review of the activities within the game round, we offer a level 5 reward for publishing a thoughtful editorial. This can be video or text, but should be a review and analysis of the current game round in your own words. Editorials must be published on a public blog-like site and shared on Twitter.

### Badges

This system will lead into a badge system, where your profile will be decorated with badges representing your accomplishments, with each badge giving a boost in voting power going forward.

### Slashes

Those who were airdropped last season but did not participate will be slashed with a negative level 5 bonus. Those who do not participate in the round 2 vote will be slashed the same amount for round 3.

### Carrying forward

These values will carry forward into future voting rounds, and the bonuses will update proportional to the total voting pool in each round.

### Activity Rewards

- Posting an in-app project or ship update each week
