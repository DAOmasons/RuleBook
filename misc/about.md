# Grant Ships: An Evolutionary Grants Framework for the Arbitrum Ecosystem

TLDR: Grant Ships allows multiple teams (aka Grant Ships) to do grant allocation under one DAO's umbrella. The sponsor DAO puts grant funds into one pile, then it is split among the multiple teams.

The Grant Ships platform allows those teams to accept applications and make allocations to chosen recipients.Every transaction recorded on chain and displayed in the app feed.

At the end of a funding round, a TCR DAO vote is held. In the following round, funding levels for each Ship is proportional to the amount of votes received.

Among other features, the game provides an anti-capture mechanism through Hats Protocol, allowing permissions to be revoked and reassigned by the sponsor DAO if needed.
