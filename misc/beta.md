### Gaming in Arbitrum

#### The core objective of this round is to encourage **innovation in gaming** on the Arbitrum network. Grant recipients are tasked with completing a project within the following categories:

- **Developing** a new feature for an existing game that introduces a unique game mechanic and incorporates on-chain actions, or
- **Creating** a self-contained game with an engaging game loop and essential blockchain integration, or
- **Producing** tooling, programs or other deliverables that have a tangible and measurable impact on the Arbitrum gaming ecosystem.

## 3 Ships, 2 Rounds

The beta will consist of 2 funding rounds. We'll have 3 ships making allocations, and performance will be assessed at the end of each round through a token curated vote.

For the first round, each ship will have 15,000 ARB allocated to them. 10% of that (1500 ARB) is paid directly to the ship operators as compensation. After round 1, an Arbitrum token vote will be held to determine funding levels for round 2. 10% of round 2 funding will be given directly to ship operators, and this amount will vary for each ship depending on the amount of the vote they receive.

## Key Points for Operators

#### Choose projects and supply grants to promote:

- **Measurable Impact:** Focus on fostering homegrown talent and catalyzing game development on Arbitrum in a way that can be observed and measured.
- **On-Arbitrum Gaming:** Encourage the use and development of games on Arbitrum.
- **Community Engagement:** Leverage the Arbitrum community's expertise, explore potential integrations with existing platforms and consider hosting events that spur creativity and engagement.
