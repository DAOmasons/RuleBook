# February 2024: Grant Ships Beta

A Grant Ships beta round has been funded by Plurality Labs for 90,000 [ARB](https://www.coinbase.com/price/arbitrum).

That means we need teams and individuals to [apply](https://forms.grantships.fun/) to become Grant Ship Operators, Game Facilitators and Grant Recipients.

## We want you!

We're looking for 3 crews (teams or individuals) to operate Grant Ships for the beta launch. Do you have what it takes to allocate funds effectively?

## 3 Ships, 3 Rounds

The beta will consist of 3 funding rounds. We'll have 3 ships making allocations, and performance will be assessed at the end of each round as a measure of percieved impact made by grant recipients and grant recipient feedback.

## Performance Matters

Performance determines the level of funding each ship will receive in subsequent rounds. If you operate a ship, try to choose impactful projects with visible outcomes that the community will support!

## Got What it Takes?

Applications are open through mid-January.
