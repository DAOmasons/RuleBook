# Hats Protocol

Grant Ships has integrated Hats Protocol for onchain, revokable permissions. That means that when you deploy a Grant Ships instance, you hold the 'Top Hat' - keeping you in control of the game. Ship Operators and Game Facilitators are given sub-Hats tokens that grant them permission to make allocation decisions (though never unilaterally).

If a Game Facilitator or Ship Operator needs to be replaced for any reason, you can remove or reassign their Hat. This Top Hat permission can be given to an individual, DAO or a multisig - whatever works best for your use case.
