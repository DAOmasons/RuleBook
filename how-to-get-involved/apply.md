# Join the Grant Ship Community

With Grant Ships, You have the unique opportunity to role of a Ship Operator. You will compete with and against other Ship Operators to best distribute funds within a funding domain.

### **Getting Started as a Ship Operator**

To participate as a Ship Operator, there must be an open funding round accepting applications. You can check if we are currently running a round that is open for Operator applications at [app.grantships.fun](https://app.grantships.fun).

### Starting a New Grant Ships Game

If we aren't running an open round, then we can help you petition your DAO to use Grant Ships for their grants program. To get this process started, reach out to us on [Telegram](https://t.me/daomasons) and let us know you'd like help getting your DAO started using Grant Ships.

## The Operator Application

The application process is 2 steps! The first step creates your Allo profile (we use Allo under the hood) but your application is not complete until you finish the 2nd step, which brings your application to the Game Facilitators for review.
