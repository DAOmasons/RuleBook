# Join the Grant Ship Community

Grant Ships is a meta framework that allows Ship operators to make great grant decisions. That means we need great projects to fund!

**Get Started as a Project Manager**
To participate, please visit [the Grant Ships app](https://app.grantships.fun/create-project) and complete the project registration form. Your project will appear on the site and on chain, and may be selected and funded by Grant Ship operators.

See the [Pilot Round Overview](/about/pilot.html) for information on the current funding round.

Joining the Grant Ship community as a Project Manager provides an opportunity to be at the forefront of innovative DAO governance and fund allocation strategies. We welcome your participation and look forward to your contributions.
