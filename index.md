features:
  - title: Pluralistic Desisgn
    details: Pluralism is our primary design consideration. Nearly all of the coordination, creativity, and decision-making is left up to the individual Grant Ships.
  - title: Accountability
    details: Grant Ships are motivated to track and report grantee progress, while grantees are encouraged to show results and progress for additional future funding.
  - title: Voter Participation
    details: This game is a spectator sport, designed to be fun to play and watch. This is necessary to ensure the ecosystem stays involved and provides the right incentives and signals.
  - title: Capture Resistance
    details: The game breaks down the usual centralized grant-giving system, spreading authority and accountability across Grant Ships, Facilitators, and voters, ensuring mutual oversight.
  - title: Adaptive Approach
    details: Through token-weighted voting, Arbitrum DAO creates the selective pressure that forces Grant Ships to evolve. As Arbitrum evolves, so will its grants program.
  - title: Progressive Decentralization
    details: The game is designed to be self regulated and ran by Arbitrum DAO as the seasons progress.
