# Jokerace

Jokerace represents a groundbreaking approach to community-driven funding, seamlessly aligning with the Grant Ship model. This platform allows for direct, bottom-up governance, enabling community members to actively participate in the grant allocation process.

## Jokerace's Integration with Grant Ships

Jokerace's on-chain governance model is an ideal fit for Grant Ships. Community members can propose and vote on grant initiatives directly on the platform, using the native token of Jokerace.

### Community-Driven Allocation
In the Jokerace ecosystem, grant allocations are determined by the community rather than a centralized authority. This democratic approach resonates with the ethos of decentralized governance.

### Multi-Chain Support
Embracing a multi-chain environment, Jokerace facilitates the deployment of Grant Ships across various EVM-compatible chains, enhancing accessibility and participation.

## Features of Jokerace's Grant Ship

### Transparent Voting
Every vote cast for grant proposals is transparent and verifiable on-chain, promoting fairness and openness in the allocation process.

### Dynamic Fund Management
The Grant Ship model under Jokerace allows for real-time adjustment of fund allocations based on community votes, ensuring that resources are directed according to collective preferences.

### Rewards and Incentives
Active participation in the grant allocation process is encouraged and rewarded with $JOKE tokens, fostering a more engaged and dynamic community.
