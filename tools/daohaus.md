# DAOhaus

## History

DAOhaus is the primary UI for the moloch DAO contracts. Moloch has long been a favorite for grant communities. Shortly after the deployment of the moloch DAO contracts, Meta Cartel forked the code and began deploying grant funding through membership fee redistribution. This model still works and Meta Cartel is still awarding grants.

The governance for Meta Cartel is now handled in the DAOhaus UI, after Meta Cartel migrated to v2 of the moloch contracts. This model aslso requires a fair amount of off chain governance and decision making before grant proposal are put on chain for the DAO to consider. So this model must include governance forums, usually handle through either Discord or Discourse. CHarmverse offers a nice option here is awell.

This has long been a popular model for grant allocation.

While the direct funding options will not be available in Grant Ships, as all funding is handled though a seperate interface, other governance options are certainly useful.

The way it could work is as follows:

- A grantee places a log form proposal on the ships forum.
- DAO will read proposal. After some discussion, a decision will be made wheather or not the proposal should go on chain.
- If approved to move to the next step, the grantee may place the proposal on chain.
- It will then be up to a Grant Ship member to sponser the proposal.
- After the proposal is sponsered, it will go to a vote.
- If the vote is in favour, the ship will present a funding request against their allocation pool.
- If everything is acceptable the funds will be distributed,
