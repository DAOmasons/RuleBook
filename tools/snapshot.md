# Snapshot: Enhancing Grant Ship Governance

Snapshot is a renowned off-chain voting platform that offers a gasless, highly customizable solution for decentralized governance. While it brings several advantages, particularly in terms of cost and flexibility, it's important to consider the nuances of off-chain governance in the context of Grant Ships.

## Why Choose Snapshot for Grant Ships?

### Gasless Voting
- **Advantage**: Allows for participation in governance without gas fees, promoting broader involvement.
- **Consideration**: Off-chain voting, while cost-effective, may lack the immutability and permanence associated with on-chain governance.

### Customizable Voting Mechanisms
- **Advantage**: Supports various voting systems, adaptable to Grant Ship needs.
- **Challenge**: Creating custom voting strategies can require technical expertise in coding, potentially limiting accessibility for those without this skill.

### Proposal and Voting Validation
- **Advantage**: Tools like Gitcoin Passport and POAPs add layers of security and authenticity.
- **Consideration**: Relying on external validation tools could introduce complexity into the governance process.

### Free and Open-Source
- **Advantage**: Aligns with the open and community-driven ethos of Grant Ships.

## Key Features of Snapshot

### Spaces, Proposals, and Votes
- Provides a structured environment for governance within Grant Ships, though it operates off-chain.

### Voting Strategies
- Custom strategies for voting power calculation allow nuanced governance but require technical know-how.

### ENS Support

## Conclusion

Snapshot offers a blend of gasless voting and customizable governance features, ideal for certain aspects of Grant Ship operations. However, its off-chain nature and the technical requirements for customization are important factors to consider when integrating it into a decentralized governance model.
