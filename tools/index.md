# Tools Index

We have included some tools to serve as samples that Grant Ships may choose from to design their grants program. These are only suggesttions meant to springboard ideation around the tools a ship can use. Every ship will be different and what works well for one ship, may not work well for the next ship.

For a very comprhensive list (but of course also incomplete) of tools check out this [Awesome DAO](https://github.com/boilerrat/awesome-decentralized-autonomous-organizations) repo.
